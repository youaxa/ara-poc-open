= ARA's Integrator Documentation

Here is how to set up ARA, configure it, and plug the continuous integration of your project onto ARA.

== Install ARA

The simplest way to install and run ARA is to use the Docker-compose script.

Open the <<../../../docker/README.adoc#head, Run ARA Using Docker>> document
and follow the first two sections: "Pre-Requisite" and "Getting Started as an Ops".

== Enable or Disable an experimental feature

ARA may contains some unstable feature, which are still under beta tests, and which are disabled on
Production instances and clones.

You can still enable some of them by using the `<host>:<port>/api/features` HTTP API (see the swagger
documentation of ARA for more details), but please note that those features are experimental and that
you may encounter unstable behavior if you're using them. If you do, please send us a copy of your ARA logs and
the context of execution / error in an issue in the project repository, it will help us a lot :)

The features can also be enable or not directly at the ARA instance startup following this rule :

* the value is setted in system property `-Dara.features.<code>=<state>`
* if not, the value is setted in the spring application.properties file `ara.features.<code>=<state>`
* if not, the value is `false`.

Where `code` is the code of the feature you want to enable. (You can list all available features with
a GET call on `<host>:<port>/api/features`).

Note that a feature state will be store in your instance memory and not your Database, so if you
have 2 ARA instances running on the same database, you can enable a feature on only one instance and not
the other one.

== Configure a Project in ARA

Once ARA is up and running, you will have to set up a project in ARA. +
Projects in ARA are spaces isolated from each other, where all your application test results will get uploaded and reports will be viewable and manipulated by the whole team.

* Go to https://{{your-ara-domain-name}}/#/management/projects +
  image:create-project.png[]
* You can click the `[ + CREATE THE DEMO PROJECT ]` button,
  play with it and its project settings to be more familiar with what an ARA project looks like.
  You can remove and/or re-create the demo project at any time.
* Once you are ready, click the `[ + ADD ]` green button in https://{{your-ara-domain-name}}/#/management/projects to create your own project

Then, to setup the project, select "MANAGE PROJECT" in the top-left project's drop-down list:

image:manage-project.png[]

Configure each screen: *provide at least one of each of the configuration entities described below*. +
A documentation text is displayed on each screen and each field of the ADD popup dialogs.

* *Teams:* just provide it/them a name: +
  image:manage-teams.png[]
* *Sources:* source repositories contain your test files: +
  image:manage-sources.png[]
* *Test types:* declare the test types that will be executed (a source can be run by several test types): +
  image:manage-types.png[]
* *Countries:* they represent different configurations in which your solution will be tested by all (or some of the) declared test types: +
  image:manage-countries.png[]
* *Severities:* they allow to partition your Cucumber scenarios and Postman requests into groups that can have various degrees of quality exigences +
  (quality exigences can vary from execution to executions, so the quality threshold of each severity is declared later): +
  image:manage-severities.png[]
* *Cycles:* configure at least one cycle per source branch on which you run automated tests, and optionaly provide more cycles for one or more branches: +
  image:manage-cycles.png[]

Additionally, it is strongly recommended to setup "Email Reports" in the Settings screen. +
You also can configure "Defects" settings to link ARA problems to your bug tracker system: +
image:manage-settings.png[]

Your project is now ready to receive its test reports.

== Send Execution Reports to ARA

Basically, here is what you need to send to ARA:

* When running Cucumber scenarios, the system gives you *a report.json file*.
* When running Newman collection(s), the system gives you *report JSON files*.

You can run several of these (they are called runs), and ship all of these grouped in one unit: the execution. +
You need to upload these files with some meta-data files and folders in order to add semantics to the report files. +
The whole set of folders and files is zipped, sent to ARA, and you are done.

=== Key Concepts

First, you need to know some additional key concepts (that were not configured when creating a project in ARA):

* A *cycle* represents a test of a branch by one or more test types
* An *execution* is the grouping of tests on several countries and/or different test types: they form one coherent test execution that can serve as making a build eligible or not
* A *run* represents the single unit of one test-type being executed for one country on one execution

=== [[tree]] Create a ZIP File

Here is the overall structure of a ZIP for an execution, with a concrete example:

* *the-execution-file-to-upload-to-ara.zip*
** *1542018261233/* - A folder whose name is the timestamp (UTC/GMT+0 number of milliseconds since January 1st, 1970) when the execution started on the continuous integration server
*** *cycleDefinition.json* - the file describing what tests are supposed to be run by this execution
                             (if executed, sub-folders will contain the outputs of each run,
                             and if one sub-folder is missing or does not contain reports,
                             then ARA will know something went wrong and will invalidate the execution because of missing expected runs;
                             the file also describes what are the quality thresholds to use to validate this execution)
*** *buildInformation.json* - describes the URL of the job on the continuous integration server where to find logs,
                              the status of the job, information about the version that was deployed and tested...
*** *fr/* - The code of the country where the tests contained in this folder were executed;
            there can be several such country folders (at least one is required, otherwise the execution will be marked as INCOMPLETE)
**** *buildInformation.json* - describes the URL of the job on the continuous integration server where to find logs and
                               the status of the job that deployed the version with this specific country configuration
**** *api/* - The code of a test type that ran for the country;
              there can be several such test-type folders (at least one is required, otherwise the execution will be marked as INCOMPLETE)
***** *buildInformation.json* - describes the URL of the job on the continuous integration server where to find logs and
                                the status of the job that executed the specific test-type and country couple
***** *reports/* - (if the test type is from a Postman source)
                   folder containing a hierarchy of *.json files being the Newman reports of ran collections;
                   the sub-folders structure reflects the sub-folders structure of the ran collection files, relative to the source VCS URL;
                   to be indexed into ARA
***** *report.json* - (if the test type is from a Cucumber source)
                      Cucumber report file to be indexed into ARA
***** *stepDefinitions.json* - (if the test type is from a Cucumber source)
                               a JSON array containing all step definition regular expressions that were used in the
                               Cucumber run: will be used to create problem aggregation rules that match a
                               step definition instead of a specific instance of the step; optional.

=== The cycleDefinition.json File

This file is created at the very beginning of the execution. +
It describes what the execution *is expected* to run. +
Some jobs in the execution can fail to start or be skipped due to earlier failures. +
With the cycleDefinition.json file, ARA is shielded from such missing data:
if one of the sub-jobs did not run, ARA will show a failed execution because of missing results, instead of showing a succeed execution because no test failed.

To construct a cycleDefinition.json, see Javadoc of:

* link:../../../server/src/main/java/com/decathlon/ara/ci/bean/CycleDef.java[CycleDef]
* link:../../../server/src/main/java/com/decathlon/ara/ci/bean/PlatformRule.java[PlatformRule]
* link:../../../server/src/main/java/com/decathlon/ara/ci/bean/QualityThreshold.java[QualityThreshold]

==== Example of a Single-Country, Two-Types cycleDefinition.json

```json
{
  "blockingValidation": true,       // If quality percentage is below thresholds, make the build not-eligible
  // This execution ran tests on platforms (a single one in this example): ...
  "platforms_rules": {
    // ... the "integration-platform" one
    "integration-platform": [
      // This is a list of countries that will be deployed on that platform: here, only one
      {
        "enabled": true,            // If false, it has the same effect than if it was not present: must be true to include the runs of that country in ARA
        "blockingValidation": true, // All test-type runs of this country are INCLUDED IN THRESHOLDS (false to make them informational)
        "testTypes": "api,firefox", // These two types will be run for that country (codes of types in ARA)
        "country": "fr",            // The country used for running these test types
        "severityTags": "all"       // Indicates the enabled severities in these runs: either "all" or a list of severity codes separated by ",": if a severity is declared to be enabled but no executed scenario matching the severity is found, the execution will be marked as INCOMPLETE: if a cycle runs only a sub-set of severities, make it explicit here to avoid such false-error
      }
    ]
  },
  // ALL of the following "failure" thresholds explained below MUST be met for the build to be declared as eligible
  // This object lists all severities declared in ARA (at least one must be declared)
  "qualityThresholds": {
    "sanity-check": {
      "failure": 100, // All @severity-sanity-check scenarios must succeed
      "warning": 100
    },
    "high": {
      "failure": 90,  // At least 90% of all @severity-high scenarios must succeed
      "warning": 95   // If between 90% and 95% of all @severity-high scenarios pass, a small warning icon will appear to let people know there is not so much remaining margin for error
    },
    "medium": {
      "failure": 80,  // At least 80% of all @severity-high scenarios must succeed
      "warning": 85
    }
  }
}
```

=== The buildInformation.json File

Each job folder have a buildInformation.json file. +
This file describes information about the job that ran either the execution, a deployment or a run or a test-type.

To construct a buildInformation.json, see Javadoc of
<<../../server/src/main/java/com/decathlon/ara/ci/bean/Build.java, Build>>.

==== Example of an Execution's buildInformation.json

```json
{
  "url": "https://build.company.com/demo/master/day/42/", // The link to the continuous integration job to put into ARA for this execution
  "result": "SUCCESS",                                    // The result of : either ABORTED, FAILURE, NOT_BUILT, SUCCESS, or UNSTABLE: will be shown alongside the job link in ARA
  "timestamp": 1542018261233,                             // Number of UNIX milliseconds representing the date & time at which the job started (since January 1st, 1970 UTC/GMT+0)
  "release": "v2",                                        // The current release of your application that is being tested
  "version": "724b1de228b72047d865d96f3c518164575caa37",  // The version of the build of your application that is being tested
  "versionTimestamp": 1542018261233                       // The date & time when the version of you application has been built (UNIX milliseconds since January 1st, 1970 UTC/GMT+0)
}
```

==== Example of an Country Deployment's buildInformation.json

Same as the execution's buildInformation.json, but with less information:

```json
{
  "url": "https://build.company.com/demo/master/day/fr/43/",
  "result": "SUCCESS",
  "timestamp": 1542018261233
}
```

==== Example of an Run's buildInformation.json

Same as the execution's buildInformation.json, but with less information:

```json
{
  "url": "https://build.company.com/demo/master/day/fr/api/44/",
  "result": "SUCCESS",
  "timestamp": 1542018261233
}
```

=== The Cucumber's report.json File

This is just the report.json produced by running Cucumber.

=== The Cucumber's stepDefinitions.json File

This file is optional. +
It lets users create aggregation rules matching Cucumber steps definitions (regular expressions) instead of just steps (scenario contents). +
For instance, the step "^Step number (\\d+)$" can be used in a scenario as "Step number 1" and "Step number 2". +
If both steps fail, it could be because the step definition is erroneous, and users would want to create a problem with just one rule aggregating both step "instances". +
If the file is not provided, ARA will threat numbers and double-quoted strings in steps as parameters and will thus try to guess what were the underlying step definitions. +
But this is very basic, error-prone, and don't account for more complex regular expressions. +
By extracting a stepDefinitions.json array file, you will be assured that ARA will let users create relevant rules.

If you decide to provide this file, it must contain a JSON array of all step definitions glue used by a Cucumber run.

Example:

```json
[
  "^A step$",
  "^A step with number (\\d+) parameter$",
  "^A step with string \"([^\"]*)\" parameter$",
]
```

As an example, in Java, just include the ara-lib library. +
Here is how to find it with Maven:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.decathlon.ara</groupId>
    <artifactId>ara-lib</artifactId>
    <version>${ara.version}</version>
</dependency>
```

The library declares the cucumber dependency as provided: you will need a working Cucumber dependency in your project
for the extractor to work: it will need to access your glue code.

Then, use the `com.decathlon.ara.lib.StepDefinitionExtractor` class like this:

```java
String outputDirectory = System.getProperty("user.dir"); // Create stepDefinitions.json in the current directory
String gluePackage = "com.company.project.tests.cucumber.glue"; // Base package containing all @Given, @When, @Then...
StepDefinitionExtractor.extract(outputDirectory, gluePackage);
```

If you have made an implementation of StepDefinitionExtractor for another language/Cucumber-flavour,
we would be glad to include it in the open-source repository of ARA.

=== Send the Execution ZIP File to ARA

Once you created the folders and files structure described above (see <<tree, Create a ZIP File>>), just zip the content. +
The execution's timestamp folder must be at the root of the ZIP.

Then, send it to ARA: +
*TODO when the HTTP connector will be done.*

== Upload Cucumber Scenarios and Postman Requests to ARA

There is an optional additional step to feed ARA with all data it needs from your project.

=== Why?

If you need:

* the tracking of @ignore Cucumber scenarios
* functionality coverage of automated tests
* team association for Cucumber scenarios and Postman requests (through functionalities)

Then, whenever a push is done on your main/default branch of your version control system,
you need to upload the Cucumber scenarios and Postman collections to ARA, so ARA can keep track of them.

This is done independently of executions, because executions can run a sub-set of scenarios, or run them several times (one run with @country-all + @country-fr, and another run with @country-all + @country-us...) or exclude all the @ignore scenarios.

=== How?

If you have several sources, you need to upload them individually. +
In ARA terminology, a source is a Version Control System (Git...) URL
to a folder containing either .feature Cucumber files or Postman collections;
a source can be used several times by different test types
(same .features files used by both "Web desktop" and "Web mobile" test types, for instance).

==== How to Upload Collections of a Postman Source?

ZIP all you *.json collections, while keeping the parent directories.

For instance, you have Postman collections like `src/main/resources/team1/subteamA/collection1.json`
and the matching ARA source have VCS URL pointing to the folder `src/main/resources` of your project,
then ZIP all JSON collections in this `src/main/resources`.
The ZIP file will then contain a `team1` folder, and a `subteamA` sub-folder, containing the JSON files.

Upload it to:

* URL: `{{ara-domain}}/api/projects/{{project-code}}/scenarios/upload-postman/{{source-code}}`
* HTTP method: `POST`
* HTTP header: `Content-Type: multipart/form-data`
* HTTP body: a form field named `file` with the ZIP file content

==== How to Upload Scenarios of a Cucumber Source?

Run Cucumber with the command-line options `--dryRun --reports json` (or its equivalent JUnit annotations).

This will create a `report.json` without running the scenarios.

Upload it to:

* URL: `{{ara-domain}}/api/projects/{{project-code}}/scenarios/upload/{{source-code}}`
* HTTP method: `POST`
* HTTP body: the `report.json` file

== Going Further: More Meta-Data for Executed Cucumber Scenarios

ARA works fine by just feeding it with a Cucumber report.json.

ARA optionally offers you to display more meta-data to help user debug scenarios more easily. +
But you need to modify how you run your Cucumber scenarios and embed special data into the report. +
To do so, please follow this documentation: <<../embed/EmbedCucumberScenarioMetaData.adoc#head, Embed Cucumber Scenario Meta-Data for ARA>>

== Bonus: Custom Cucumber to Allow Several Steps to Fail in a Single Scenario

Sometimes, you need to let several steps of a Cucumber scenario to fail.

For instance, a scenario can go through a slow process on a website, and check several information are well displayed at the end. +
You may want each check to have its own Cucumber step for better debugging what information is not displayed correctly. +
By default, Cucumber will stop the scenario at the first failed step. +
If the first check step fails, you then have no idea if the following checks would pass or fail.

You can use this Cucumber fork in order to mark some @Then steps as "soft-failures", and allow

https://github.com/slaout/cucumber-jvm

ARA supports this.

As an extra, this fork also enable you to run scenarios in parallel (and not just feature files), and annotate some scenarios to run synchronously.
